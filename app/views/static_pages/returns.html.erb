<h1>Free Returns</h1>

<p>Fact:  In 2013, less than 1% of our customers returned their photograph(s).  If you are still undecided on purchasing a photograph, the odds are on your side.</p>

<p>If for any reason you are not 100% satisfied, you can return any photograph free of charge and then you will receive a full refund ( including the cost of tax & initial shipping ).</p>

<h2>Our Return Policy</h2>

<p>Please notify us within 14 calendar days (not business days) of when you received the package and we will send you a free return shipping label.  You will be ineligible for free return shipping if we are contacted past that time period.</p>

<h2 class='return_divider'>Instructions For A Return</h2>
<p>Email us at <span class='email_link'><%= mail_to 'horschgallery@gmail.com', nil, subject: 'HorschGallery Return' %></span> and fill out the remaining details in the body of the email.

<p class='fixit'>Once we receive your return request we will send you another email with a UPS return shipping label which you can then place on the top of your return package.</p>

<h2>Return Packaging</h2>
<p>Please package the photograph(s) back up in the same (if not similar) fashion as how they were original sent to you by using as much cardboard and/or insulation as possible.  Also, if shipping back a framed photo, please use the cardboard corners which came with the print.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we will not be able to credit you for the extra packaging you may need such as a new box, bubble wrap, cardboard etc.   However, as mentioned above, we will pay for the entire return USP shipping fee back to our warehouse.</p>

<p>Here is a sample of what the UPS return label will look like.  Just print this off from within your email and then attach it to the top of your return package.</p>
